# Natural-Language-Processing
A report comparing methods used in natural language processing (in particular sentiment classification here, but the methods are generalisable to other tasks). 
The methods in this report vary from simple Naive Bayes approaches, to more mathematically complex algorithms such as the use of Support Vector Machines, and finally more neural techniques with Doc2Vec. TSNE was also used to compare the sentiment relationships in the training texts (1. a set of 2000 reviews of positive and negative sentiment, and 2. the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset).
